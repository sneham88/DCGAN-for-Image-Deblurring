# DCGAN-for-Image-Deblurring
This project implements both a baseline Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with a hybrid deblurring pipeline combining a DCGAN with the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm to restore sharp satellite imagery from Gaussian and optically aberrated blur conditions. The results from the baseline DCGAN were strong, but the results from the hybrid model had revealed that while the deblurred images showed reasonable improvement in objective fidelity, they still lacked clarity in perceptual realism, as judged by perception metrics like LPIPS. These findings indicate the promising potential of hybrid deep learning approaches for deblurring to support greater accuracy in downstream state-of-the-art image processing applications.
